# SUS STRING EXTRACTOR

Prototype for a command line interface for further analysing text files containing strings extracted from malware samples. The idea is to symplify malware analysis. The strings that are searched for are patterns belonging to the following categories:
- Wanacry Language Indicators
- Windows Directories
- URLs
- Binaries & Executables
- XML tags
- Possible base 64 strings (there is an option to decode the strings if found)
- IP Addresses
- Calls to golang APIs 
- Known malitious addresses
